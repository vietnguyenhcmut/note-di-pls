This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Summary
This is a project to help the users manage their notes. 
- Frontend: NextJS, Ant Design
- Backend: NestJS
For basic purpose, I only use backend right in this project, integrated with the frontend environment, no databases, only text files to contain texts.

## Getting Started
First, Clone the project to local.

Second, run the frontend environment:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
Third, navigate to backend folder, run the backend environment:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the frontend UI.
And the [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) is the running backend.


You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
